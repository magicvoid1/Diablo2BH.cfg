# Diablo2BH.cfg
Custom MapHackConfig for SlashDiablo

Versions:
BH.cfg - default with items grouped and comments
BH-soft.cfg - items with individual lines sorted by the slot they can be equiped in, each item has a comment
BH-hard.cfg - items grouped losely by type and the slot they can be equiped in, each group of items has a comment
BH-bare.cfg - items grouped losely, soon to be reduced in size to improve performance(aiming for <13KB), lacks comments



Things left to fix: good magical item(while shopping), LLD items.
